"""Tensor-parallel linear layers.

At ``tp_size==1`` these hold full-size weights and skip all collectives, so they
are numerically identical to plain ``nn.Linear`` and preserve the single-card
byte parity. At ``tp_size>1`` each rank holds a per-partition shard and inserts
the same all-reduce / all-gather the native C++ parallel layers use (via
:mod:`python.distributed`).
